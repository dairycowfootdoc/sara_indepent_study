## Events Formatted

This is the main fundamental file driving the values in all other files. This file was created using the EVENTS\2S2000C #1 #2 #4 #5 #6 #11 #12 #13 #15 #28 #29 #30 #31 #32 #38 #40 #43 command in Dairy Comp 305.

Each row is an "event" which specifies the animal, lactation, date, and description (event, remark, protoocls etc.) of what happened to that animal on that day.

The events_formated files drops the original column names and uses standard ones which have been formatted.  If there is a problem with the formatting the events_all_columns file can be used to chase any issues.  

```{r}

select_df<-"events_formatted.parquet" # from list_intermediate_files
fxn_graph_file_skim()

```

## Animals

This file lists each animal as a row. id_animal is the unique identifier of each animal. There should be one unique date for each date in this table, but sometimes there is not. Thus there are date_XXX_max variables.
```{r animals}

select_df<-"animals.parquet" # from list_intermediate_files
fxn_graph_file_skim()
              
```

## Animal Lactations

This file lists each animal lactation as a row. id_animal_lact is the unique identifier of each animal lactation. There should be one unique date for each date in this table, but sometimes there is not. Thus there are date_XXX_max variables.
```{r animal lact}

select_df<-"animal_lactations.parquet" # from list_intermediate_files
fxn_graph_file_skim()
              
```
